# Poppy Creature
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/poppy-creature.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/poppy-creature/)

This package provides the required tools to define a new Poppy Creature. It is based on the [pypot](https://github.com/poppy-project/pypot) library which handles the robot instantiation (both real or simulated) and the motors control.

This package should only be useful for people wanting to define their own Poppy Creature. If you want to use an existing one please refer to [Poppy Humanoid](https://github.com/poppy-project/Poppy-Humanoid) or [Poppy Ergo Jr](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-ergo-jr).
